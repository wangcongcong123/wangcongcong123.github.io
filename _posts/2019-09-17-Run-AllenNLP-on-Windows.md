title: Run AllenNLP on Windows
---

As I said, currently, I am a big fun of [AI2](https://allenai.org/index.html). This began when I got knowing its work into an open-source NLP research library - [AllenNLP](https://allennlp.org/). The more I hack the library, the more attractive it is for me. A short paragraph of praise below was written when I was hacking the tool.


> I appreciate how the library strongly reflects the importance of reproducibility and conciseness regarding code design. It is not only a good example of my future code writing but also a motivation for me becoming an excellent researcher with the open-source concept in mind. The tool definitely helps me solve a lot of trivial time-consuming dirty work and enables me to focus on the most important part in research - logic and creative thinking. 


If you aspire to be a NLP researcher, this wonderful library is highly recommened as starting point in terms of programing NLP. Anyway, it is a good tool for running reproducible experiments which I think is pretty much important for not only NLP reseachers but researchers in other areas. More about its contribution to reproducibility, [the slides by Joel Grus](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ivK8AKgz8Hx-ZYzPC9gJyQK6tzuhR3UuhCEajFGJDlA/edit) are good references. To start AllenNLP, there are a number of good tutorials available on [its git repository page](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp).


Although I have played some time with AllenNLP on Mac OS and Linux, unfortunately, the library is still unavailable for Windows. This blog provides a way of making a detour to enable AllenNLP run on Windows. Instructions are below.

Pending to finish (include youtube video instructions on how to achieve the goal)
